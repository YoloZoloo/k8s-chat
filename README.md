# k8s-chat
This is the k8s cloud version of chat application.

This application uses a public docker image that bundled the following application.
https://github.com/YoloZoloo/chat-frontend
https://github.com/YoloZoloo/chat-backend

For now the service names can't be changed because these names are hardcoded. In the future it will be decoupled from the code with a help of configmaps.
If you think you can fix it. Feel free to create a pull request.
